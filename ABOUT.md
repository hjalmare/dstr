# About 
This project is created for me to learn and experiment with Zig, and to try out a few things.

The goals/philosophy of the project are the following:
* Be respectful of the computers resources and do not waste them
* No dependencies outside Zigs standard library
* Just code it, focus on just getting the code out. Do not get stuck on naming, structure etc.
* Rely primarily on black box testing.
* Keep code compact, and do not use unessesary indirection
* I do what i want, this project is for fun

# Some takeaways so far
* Black box testing is nice, i have rewritten the parser from scratch several times without changing a single test for example.
* Its possible to write very fast programs in Zig without much experience in low level languages.
* Doing lexing and parsing in one step can be really tricky
